	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a software developer working on machine learning at SAP. I received 
	a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Indiana University Bloomington, after 
	which I worked as a researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I 
	made the transition to industry and now I enjoy a daily dosis of Python 
	coding, mining text data, and playing with maps.</p>
