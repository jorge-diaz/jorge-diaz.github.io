	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a software developer working on machine learning at SAP. I received 
	a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Indiana University Bloomington in the 
	USA, after which I moved to Germany to work as a researcher at the <a href="https://www.itp.kit.edu/~jsdiaz/" target="_blank">Karlsruhe 
	Institute of Technology</a>. I made the transition to industry and now I enjoy a 
	daily dosis of Python coding, mining text data, and playing with maps. My 
	fascination for physics is now streamed via <a href="https://twitter.com/jsdiaz_" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and a <a href="https://conexioncausal.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> for the 
	general public.</p>
